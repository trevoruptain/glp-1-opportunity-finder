# GLP-1 Opportunity Finder

A research tool for exploring non-diabetes indications for GLP-1 drugs.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Make sure you have Docker installed**
2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. **Open your browser**: 
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API docs: http://localhost:8005/docs

4. **Stop the app**: Press `Ctrl+C` or run `docker-compose down`

## üéØ Workshop Challenges

This app is designed for hands-on AI-assisted coding practice. Pick a challenge and start coding:

### Available Workshops:

1. **üìä Export Report Feature** - Build a CSV download feature
   ```bash
   git checkout workshop-1-export
   ```

2. **üêõ Debug Broken Prioritization** - Fix the scoring algorithm  
   ```bash
   git checkout workshop-2-debug
   ```

3. **üîç Add Search Filters** - Build filtering UI components
   ```bash
   git checkout workshop-3-filters
   ```

4. **üìà Fix Data Parsing Bug** - Debug the data pipeline
   ```bash
   git checkout workshop-4-parsing
   ```

5. **‚ö° Add Health Check** - Build monitoring tools
   ```bash
   git checkout workshop-5-health
   ```

### How It Works:
1. **Pick a workshop branch** (see above)
2. **Read the challenge README** in that branch
3. **Try fixing it yourself first**
4. **Use AI assistance** with the provided example prompts
5. **Check the solution** when you're done

## üí° AI Coding Tips

- Paste errors directly into your AI assistant
- Ask it to explain unfamiliar code
- Let it write tests and debug scripts
- Treat it like a pair programming partner

# üìä Workshop 1: Export Report Feature

## üéØ The Challenge

Your product manager just asked:

> "Hey, can users export their research results as a CSV file? I see there's an Export Report button, but it doesn't work yet."

## üîç What's Currently Broken

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Search for literature (pick any molecule) 
3. Click "Export Report" ‚Üí You'll see an alert saying it's not implemented

## üõ†Ô∏è Your Mission

Implement the CSV export functionality so users can download their research results.

**Expected behavior:**
- Download a CSV file named `glp1-research-results.csv`
- Include columns: Disease Name, Prevalence, Treatment Status, Priority Score, Sources
- Only export diseases that have actual data (not "Pending" ones)

## üí° Approach

1. **Try it yourself first** - Look at the button in `frontend/components/results-panel.tsx`
2. **Use AI assistance** - Paste errors, ask it to explain the code structure
3. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure the CSV downloads and opens correctly

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] CSV file downloads when button is clicked
- [ ] File includes all expected columns  
- [ ] Only exports diseases with actual data
- [ ] File opens correctly in Excel/Google Sheets
